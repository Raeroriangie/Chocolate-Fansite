  <h1>Love, Chocolate</h1>
  <p>I have been to heaven before. It was the day I discovered chocolate.</p>
  <p>Love on my lips, magic on my tongue; it was divine.</p>
  <p>Blessed by it's holy flavour, my soul transcended.</p>
  <p>I became consumed by the creaminess of white chocolate.</p>
  <p>Bewitched by the dark magic of dark chocolate,</p>
  <p>And possessed by every shade in between.</p><br/>
  <p>To you, Chocolate, I pledge my love.</p><br/>
  <p>There is no heaven greater than you.</p>
